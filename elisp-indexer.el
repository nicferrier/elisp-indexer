;;; Commentary:

;; When developing packages of EmacsLisp one often has the package
;; installed.  If you use the Emacs help system to find functions or
;; variables this will mostly take you to the packaged version. Often,
;; this is not what you want. Once I spent a whole day tracing a bug
;; because I had edited the packaged version of a function instead of
;; the source controlled version.

;; When you look up a function or variable Emacs should know that you
;; have a source controlled version of the same code and it should be
;; able to show you links to that. That's what this code does.

;; An etags based indexer is used, after every elisp file is saved the
;; index is updated. There is also a shell script to batch create (or
;; recreate) the entire index. Whenever a function is looked up in
;; help the results are emended with anything discovered in the index.
