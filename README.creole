= Improving the Emacs help system =

When developing packages of EmacsLisp one often has the package
installed.  If you use the Emacs help system to find functions or
variables this will mostly take you to the packaged version. Often,
this is not what you want. Once I spent a whole day tracing a bug
because I had edited the packaged version of a function instead of
the source controlled version.

When you look up a function or variable Emacs should know that you
have a source controlled version of the same code and it should be
able to show you links to that. That's what this code does.

An etags based indexer is used, after every elisp file is saved the
index is updated. There is also a shell script to batch create (or
recreate) the entire index. Whenever a function is looked up in
help the results are emended with anything discovered in the index.


I had to completly rewrite the help for now. I say completly. But what
I mean is //pinch the code from the help system and then re-arrange it
slightly//.

It seems like it's at best unreliable to edit {{{*Help*}}} buffers
after they've been made. So rewriting was the quickest way to get
something that worked.

Some of it was basically refactoring and seemed useful anyway. For
example, splitting off {{{elispindex/what-is-this-function}}} seemed
worthwhile. It's just possible that other people might want that.
